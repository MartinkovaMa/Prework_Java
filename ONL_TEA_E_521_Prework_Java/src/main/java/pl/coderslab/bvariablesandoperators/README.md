Remember to place exercise solutions in the appropriate `java` files prepared for the exercises.  

## Exercise 1

In the method `main` of the `Main01.java` file, create variables for the given types and initialize them (set values):

1. int
2. char
3. long
4. double
5. boolean

Create variable names according to the following pattern: `type` and sub-task number, e.g: `int1` or `boolean5`.



## Exercise 2

In the `main` method of the `Main02.java` file, create three variables:
- `n01` of the type `byte` with a value of `94`,
- `n02` of the type `short` with a value of `257`,
- `result` of the type `int`, that stores the sum of the two previous variables (use the addition sign `+`).

1. The values have to be set in a single line, together with the declaration, that is:
```type variableName = variableValue;```

2. Print the value of the `result` variable on the console.


## Exercise 3

In the `main` method of the `Main03.java` file, create three variables:
- `no1` of the `int` type with a value of `5`,
- `no2` of the `int` type with a value of `3`,
- `result` of the `int` type, that stores the remainder of the division (**modulo**) of those two numbers - **no1 modulo no2**.

1. The values should be set in a single line, together with the declaration, that is:
```` type variableName = variableValue;````

2. Print out the value of the `result` variable on the console.



## Exercise 4

In the `main` method of the `Main04.java` file, create three variables:
- `str1` of the `String` type with a value: `Java`,
- `str2` of the `String` type with a value: `Course`,
- `joinedStrings` of the `String` type, that stores the combined strings, separated by a space.

1. The values must be set in a single line, together with the declaration, that is:
```` type variableName = variableValue;````

2. To join the strings, use the concatenation sign (`+`) and an additional space in the form:
```" "```

3. Print out the value of the `joinedStrings` variable on the console.

Expected result:
````
Java Course
````


## Exercise 5


In the `main` method of the `Main05.java` file, create three variables:
- `no1` of the `double` type with a value of `5.1`,
- `no2` of the `float` type with a value of `5.0f`,
- `result` of the `boolean` type, storing the result of a check whether the first number is greater than the second one.

1. The values must be set in a single line, together with the declaration, that is:
```` type variableName = variableValue;````

2. Print out the value of the `result` variable on the console.

Expected result:
````
true
````
